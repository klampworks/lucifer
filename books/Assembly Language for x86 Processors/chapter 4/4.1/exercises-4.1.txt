1. What are the three basic types of operands?

† Register, memory location and immediate value.

2. (True/False): The destination operand of a MOV instruction cannot be a segment register.

† False.

3. (True/False): In a MOV instruction, the second operand is known as the destination operand.

† In AT&T Syntx maybe...

4. (True/False): The EIP register cannot be the destination operand of a MOV instruction.

† True.

5. In the operand notation used by Intel, what does reg/mem32 indicate?

† 32 bit wide register or memory location.

6. In the operand notation used by Intel, what does imm16 indicate?

† 16 bit immediate value.

Use the following variable definitions for the remaining questions in this section:

.data
var1 SBYTE -4,-2,3,1
var2 WORD 1000h,2000h,3000h,4000h
var3 SWORD -16,-42
var4 DWORD 1,2,3,4,5

7. For each of the following statements, state whether or not the instruction is valid:

a.
	mov ax,var1
	† Invalid, ax is a 16 bit register.
b.
 	mov ax,var2
	† Valid.
c.
	mov eax,var3
	† Invalid.
d.
 	mov var2,var3
	† Invalid, both operands are memory locations.
e.
 	movzx ax,var2
	† Valid.
f.
	movzx var2,al
	† Valid.
g.
	mov ds,ax
	† Valid.
h.
 	mov ds,1000h
	† Valid.

8. What will be the hexadecimal value of the destination operand after each of
the following instructions execute in sequence?

mov al,var1 	; a.
mov ah,[var1+3] ; b.

† a al = 0xfc
  b ah = 0x1 (eax = 0x1fc)


9. What will be the value of the destination operand after each of the following instructions execute in sequence?
mov ax,var2 	; a.
mov ax,[var2+4] ; b.
mov ax,var3 	; c.
mov ax,[var3-2] ; d.

† a ax = 0x1000
  b ax = 0x3000
  c ax = 0xfff0
  d ax = 0x4000

10. What will be the value of the destination operand after each of the following instructions execute in sequence?

mov edx,var4	; a.
movzx edx,var2	; b.
mov edx,[var4+4]; c.
movsx edx,var1	; d.

† a edx = 0x1
  b edx = 0x1000
  c edx = 0x2
  d edx = 0xfffffffc
