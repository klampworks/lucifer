1. What are the x86 processor’s three basic modes of operation?

† Real, protected and virtual 8086.

2. Name all eight 32-bit general-purpose registers.

† eax, ebx, ecx, edx, esp, ebp, esi, edi

3. Name all six segment registers.

† cs, ss, ds, es, fs, gs

4. What special purpose does the ECX register serve?

† It is used as a loop counter by the CPU.

5. Besides the stack pointer (ESP), what other register points to variables on the stack?

† ebp, the base pointer.

6. Name at least four CPU status flags.

† Overflow, Zero, overflow, carry.

7. Which flag is set when the result of an unsigned arithmetic operation is too large to fit into the destination?

† Carry.

8. Which flag is set when the result of a signed arithmetic operation is either too large or too small to fit into the destination?

† Overflow.

9. Which flag is set when an arithmetic or logical operation generates a negative result?

† Sign.

10. Which part of the CPU performs floating-point arithmetic?

The floating pointing point.

11. How many bits long are the FPU data registers?

† 80 bits aparently.

12. Which Intel processor was the first member of the IA-32 family?

† Intel 80386.

13. Which Intel processor first introduced superscalar execution?

† Pentium.

14. Which Intel processor first used MMX technology?

† Pentium.

15. Describe the CISC design approach.

† Complex instructin set allows fewer instructions but a longer time to decode
and execute each one through microcode.

16. Describe the RISC design approach.

† Short instructions executed in hardware.
