1. Identify valid suffix characters used in integer constants.

h, o, d, b, r, t and y.

2. (Yes/No): Is A5h a valid hexadecimal constant?

† Yes, 165.

3. (Yes/No): Does the multiplication operator (*) have a higher precedence
than the division operator (/) in integer expressions?

† No, they are the same.

4. Write a constant expression that divides 10 by 3 and returns the integer
remainder.

† Extern.

5. Show an example of a valid real number constant with an exponent.

† Extern.

6. (Yes/No): Must string constants be enclosed in single quotes?

† They may be enclosed in single quotes too.

7. Reserved words can be instruction mnemonics, attributes, operators,
predefined symbols, and __________.

† Register names.

8. What is the maximum length of an identifier?

† 247 characters.

9. (True/False): An identifier cannot begin with a numeric digit.

† True.

10. (True/False): Assembly language identifiers are (by default) case insensitive.

† True.

11. (True/False): Assembler directives execute at runtime.

† False.

12. (True/False): Assembler directives can be written in any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

† True.

13. Name the four basic parts of an assembly language instruction.

Optional label, operation, operands, optional comment.

14. (True/False): MOV is an example of an instruction mnemonic.

† True.

15. (True/False): A code label is followed by a colon (:), but a data label
does not have a colon.

† True.

16. Show an example of a block comment.

† Extern.

17. Why would it not be a good idea to use numeric addresses when writing
instructions that access variables?

† Variables may not always reside at the same address, especially on a system
that implements space layout randomisation.
