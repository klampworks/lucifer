1. Of the four levels of input/output in a computer system, which is the most universal and portable?

† Library functions.

2. What characteristics distinguish BIOS-level input/output?

† To control device specific features.

3. Why are device drivers necessary, given that the BIOS already has code that communicates with the computer’s hardware?

† Adding new hardware should not require a BIOS upgrade, only a new OS driver.

4. In the example regarding displaying a string of characters, which level
exists between the operating system and the video controller card?

† Bios.

5. At which level(s) can an assembly language program manipulate input/output?

† Depends if there is an operating system in the way or not.

6. Why do game programs often send their sound output directly to the sound card’s hardware ports?

† Performance I guess.

7. Challenge: Is it likely that the BIOS for a computer running MS-Windows would be different from that used by a computer running Linux?

† Not likely but there are open source BIOS implementations.
