My first serious attempt at learning x86 assembly. Thought the book is aimed towards maniacs who want to learn assembly as their first ever programming language I thought it was a great introduction for developers at any level. The book teaches x86 assembly within a Linux environment using the AT&T syntax. It covers all the basics from file operations to dynamic memory management. It gives a great insight into the inner workings of those things like printf and malloc that we take for granted.
