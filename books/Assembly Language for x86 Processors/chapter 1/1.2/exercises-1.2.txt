1. In your own words, describe the virtual machine concept.

† Source code is translated into byte code which is compiled into native code
by the virtual machine at runtime. Issues of portability are then handled by
the developers of the VM and not regular language users.

2. Why don’t programmers write application programs in machine language?

† Slow and error prone. The cons outweigh and pros for most types of
applications.

3. (True/False): When an interpreted program written in language L1 runs, each
of its instructions is decoded and executed by a program written in language L0.

† False, there are interpreters written in their own langauge i.e. pypy both
interprets Python and is itself written in Python.

4. Explain the technique of translation when dealing with languages at different virtual machine levels.

† Bytecode for the higher level vm is translated into bytecode for the lower
layer VM instead of into native code.

5. At which level does assembly language appear in the virtual machine example
shown in this section?

† The bottom above hardware.

6. What software permits compiled Java programs to run on almost any computer?

† The Java Virtual Machine.

7. Name the four virtual machine levels named in this section, from lowest to highest.
8. Why don’t programmers write applications in machine language?

† For the same reason as question 2.

9. Machine language is used at which level of the virtual machine shown in Figure 1–1?

† Level 2.
