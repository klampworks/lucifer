1. The central processor unit (CPU) contains registers and what other basic elements?

† Clock, contorl until, and arithmatic logic unit.

2. The central processor unit is connected to the rest of the computer system using what three buses?

† Address, data, and control bus.

3. Why does memory access take more machine cycles than register access?

† Because data must be fetched through the system bus.

4. What are the three basic steps in the instruction execution cycle?

† Fetach, decode, execute.

5. Which two additional steps are required in the instruction execution cycle when a memory operand is used?

† Fetch and store the operands.

6. During which stage of the instruction execution cycle is the program counter incremented?

† During the fetch phase.

7. When a program runs, what information does the OS read from the filename’s disk directory entry?

† File size and physical location.

8. After a program has been loaded into memory, how does it begin execution?

† One instruction at a time.

9. Define multitasking.

† Seperate tasks sharing the CPU in a way that makes it seem to the use that
they are all running at the same time,

10. What is the function of the OS scheduler?

† To assign time slices to different processes and decide which one to run
next.

11. When the processor switches from one task to another, what values in the first task’s state must be preserved?

† Registers.

12. What is the duration of a single clock cycle in a 3-GHz processor?
