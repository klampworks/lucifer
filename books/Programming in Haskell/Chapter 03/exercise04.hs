{-
 - Exercise 3-4.
 -
 - Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances 
 - of the Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type 
 - are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

 {-
  - â€  How can the compiler decide if two functions return the same value
  - without executing the code? What if the functions do not return at all?
