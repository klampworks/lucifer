section-sort(A)

	for i = 1 to A.length - 1
		min = i
		for j = i to A.length
			if A[j] < A[min]
				min = j
		swap A[min], A[i]

loop invariant: Everything smaller than i is sorted.

It runs for n-1 iterations because when i = n, everything before i is sorted and n
is sorted by virtue of being a single element array.

O(n^2)

2.2-3
On average a linear search will iterate through half the elemetns if the element
being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array.

O(n) for bpth cases because we do not concern ourselves with constants in O-notation.
