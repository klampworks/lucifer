1.1-1
	A system displaying lists of alphanumeric data may need to order them sequencially.

1.1-2
	Memory is the most obvious measure of efficiency other than speed. 

1.1-3
	A linked list is easy to implement and provides a quick way of prepending elements to the head of the list; the tail too if it is indexed by another variable. One weakness of a linked list is that it cannot be searched easily. Elements must be accessed one at a time in a linear fashion.

1.1-4
	The shortest path and traveling salesman problems are similar in the respect that all possible routes for any non trivial instance of a problem is too large to generate. One way they differ is that the latter requires a route to go through all the points and return to the starting posintion.

1.1-5
	The traveling salesman is an example of a problem where an approximatley best solution is sufficiant. Cryptography is an example of a problem where the ebst solution is required.
