/*
 * Exercise 3.
 *
 * The string facilities are not perfectly regular. For example, you can 
 * assign a char to a string, but you cannot initialize a string with a char. 
 * Make a list of such irregularities. Which could have been eliminated 
 * without complicating the use of strings? What other irregularities
 * would this introduce?
