{-
 - Exercise 7-8.
 -
 - Modify the string transmitter program to detect simple transmission errors
 - using parity bits. That is, each eight-bit binary number produced during
 - encoding is extended with a parity bit, set to one if the number contains
 - an odd number of ones, and to zero otherwise. In turn, each resulting nine-
 - bit binary number consumed during decoding is checked to ensure that its
 - parity bit is correct, with the parity bit being discarded if this is the case,
 - and a parity error reported otherwise.
 - Hint: the library function error :: String â†’ a terminates evaluation and
 - displays the given string as an error message.
